# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository overview

gem5 is a modular computer architecture simulator.

Key parts of this repo:
- `src/`: C++ simulator core (built with SCons)
- `src/python/`: Python packages used by gem5 (incl. gem5 “standard library”)
- `configs/`: example simulation configuration scripts
- `tests/`: test harness and test suites (entry: `tests/main.py`)
- `util/`: developer utilities (style checker, hooks)

## Required workflow in this repo

### Use the docker environment only for build/test/format

```sh
docker exec -i "${USER}.gem5" bash -lc "cd /gem5 && <command>"
```

Use the docker environment if and only if you need to build, test, or run formatting/style checks.

For other tasks, such as code search, reading files, reviewing code, or general repository inspection, do not use the docker environment.

### Build (defaults)

- Always build with **`-j32`**.
- Default ISA target is **RISCV**.

Common build:
```sh
scons -j32 build/RISCV/gem5.opt
```

If you need SCons options/help:
```sh
scons -h
```

### Testing (required after changes)

After *each* code change, you must:
1) Add/extend **unit tests** covering the changed behavior.
2) **Build and run** the relevant unit tests to validate correctness.

For a single test, run:
```sh
cd tests
./main.py run -j32 --skip-build <test-folder-name> -vvv
```

If needed, use the debug output to find the generated run directory, then inspect `simout.txt` and `simerr.txt` there to help identify the root cause.

### Formatting / style checks (required)

Inside the docker environment, do **not** install extra dependencies.

After writing code, run formatting/style checks (typical choices in this repo):
```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

And/or run gem5’s style checker (whole-file or modified regions):
```sh
util/style.py
util/style.py -m
```

## Architecture & code structure (big picture)

### Build system layering

- `SConstruct` is the top-level entrypoint.
  - Defines build targets like `build/<ISA>/gem5.{debug,opt,fast}`.
  - Supports Kconfig-based configuration for build directories (e.g., `scons menuconfig <builddir>`).
  - Configures toolchain features (C++17, sanitizers, embedded Python, etc.).
- `src/SConscript` defines how sources are collected and built, including Python embedding/build rules.

Practical implication: when adding new C++ files or new SimObjects, you typically need to update the relevant `SConscript`/`SConsopts` files in that subtree so they’re included in the build.

### Python ↔ C++ boundary (SimObjects)

A central concept is the **SimObject**:
- SimObjects are configured in Python and instantiated/bound into the C++ simulator.
- The build generates parameter structures and related C++ artifacts from Python SimObject definitions (see `src/SConscript` for `SimObject`/`PySource` build rules).

Practical implication: adding/changing parameters commonly touches both Python and C++ plus the build glue that generates params.

## Testing guidance

For `tests/gem5/` structure, pass/fail conventions, build/run workflow, and the recommended pattern of automated verification plus preserved artifacts for human inspection, see:

- `.agent/skill/testing-gem5.md`

For `tests/gem5/npu/`, additionally follow the testcase structure and rules in:

- `.agent/skill/testing-gem5-npu.md`

When touching `tests/gem5/npu/`, treat the current checked-in structure as:

- testcase entry files live at `tests/gem5/npu/testcases/<module>/<case>/test.py`
- shared Python infra lives under `tests/gem5/npu/configs/`
- shared workload headers currently live under `tests/gem5/npu/utils/`

Do not assume the planned `software_utils/` rename has already happened unless
the tree actually contains that directory.

Prefer these notes when asked about writing, reviewing, or debugging gem5 tests. Unless explicitly requested by the user, do not retain or prioritize `tests/pyunit/` guidance.

## Commit conventions (repo-enforced)

- Commit headers must start with one or more **tags** (from `MAINTAINERS.yaml`) followed by a colon, e.g. `mem-ruby: ...` or `mem,mem-cache: ...`.
- Header line (tags + title) must be **≤ 65 characters**.
- If there’s a body, the header must be followed by an empty line.

These rules are enforced by the commit-msg hook (`util/git-commit-msg.py`) when pre-commit is installed.
