# NPU C Helper Layout

> 说明：本目录是 `software_utils/` 的迁移前暂存位置。V2 目标是把这里整体重命名为 `tests/gem5/npu/software_utils/`，并保持现有头文件名与 `#include` 方式不变。

- `npu_mmio.hh`: contiguous `uint32_t` MMIO read/write helpers.
- `npu_mem.hh`: shared slot-pointer, SPM/region clear, and vector
  load/store/fill helpers for testcase workloads.
- `npu_assert.hh`: shared wait/compare/assert helpers plus float bit-cast
  utilities and vector dump helpers.
- `cmd/common.hh`: shared macro-command container, common header fields, field get/set helpers, and launch helpers.
- `cmd/vpu.hh`: VPU opcode enum plus typed launch helpers for unary, binary,
  ternary, scale, and explicit queue-port variants.
- `npu_sync.hh`: sync-wait, sync-set, and `rvSyncCmdDone` completion helpers built on `cmd/common.hh`.
- `golden/`: software reference models for testcase expected-value calculation.

Common macro-command header fields currently live in the first 32 bits of `cmd/common.hh` word 0:
- `device_type` at bits `[31:28]`
- `device_id` at bits `[27:24]`
- `op_code` at bits `[23:16]`
- `sync_indicator` at bits `[15:8]`
- `set_indicator_sns` at bit `[7]`
- `set_indicator_snd` at bit `[6]`
- reserved bits at `[5:0]`

Completion convention for NPU tests:
- End RV workloads with `npu_cmd_sync_done()` or `npu_cmd_sync_done_at(port_base)` after all macro commands have been submitted.
- Let the blocking MMIO response from `MegaCmdQueue` be the completion fence.
- Keep Python-side post-exit checks for debug counters such as queue occupancy and completed command counts.
- Do not use Python polling loops to infer macro-command completion when the testcase is backed by `MegaCmdQueue`.

Current VPU helper notes:
- `vpu_cmd_init()` now sets the SNS bit automatically when `sync_indicator != 0`.
- `_at` helper variants are the preferred way to target non-zero `MegaCmdQueue`
  input-port windows in multi-port system tests.
- For shared-LUT tests, prefer workload-side result validation plus Python-side
  checks on `LutUnit` and mirrored `VpuUnit` timing counters.

Prefer named field setters/getters for common header bits. Add new files under `software_utils/cmd/` only when a command view becomes stable and clearly reused.
